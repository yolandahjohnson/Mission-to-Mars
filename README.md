# Mission-to-Mars
 
## Overview
The purpose of Mission-to Mars is to scrape information about Mars from various websites and create a web app specifically about Mars. The client, Robin, would like to add images of Mars' four hemispheres.  To do this, I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
